==================================
Limits, Costs, Logging
==================================

Usage Limits
------------

There is no request limit per default. The API is therefore only restricted by the hardware resource limits.
10000 requests per hour or more should be possible without any further tweaking.

Higher request rates are possible by updating the hardware plan of your Fundraising Studio subscription.
Please contact us at least a week before you need a higher request rate so that we can assign the needed hardware
early enough for you.

.. attention:: We may add a request limit at any time with no prior message if we detect any suspicious traffic.

Usage Costs
-----------

Up to 10000 requests per month are free of charge. If you need more than that we will charge a small contribution
for our expenses based on the total amount of requests per month. Please check your contract or quotation for
pricing details.

A report of the usage statistic can be provided if needed.

Repair Costs
------------

Costs that may arise by misuse of the api will be charged to the api user.

Logging
-------

The API logs every request with all the request data and may even collect data of the caller. This logging can be
reduced to exclude request and caller data if needed e.g. by GPDR rules. We will keep the full log in case of
suspicious activities or abuse to be able to track the source of a possible security breach.

In addition a very basic usage statistic log will be kept for 14 months.

These logs may be deleted by us at any time with no warning.
