website_sale_login
==================

Check e-mail address for existing partner or user account at checkout.

shop/checkout and shop/confirm_order

- User/Partner detection by e-mail in shop/checkout and shop/confirm_order controllers
- Show messages for signup or account creation if partner/user found
- Continue without signup and show messages only once or only at email change if web-user decides to go on without sign in / sign up
- Quick checkout possible through get variables transfers to /checkout with prefilled form and the product already in basket
  e.g.: /shop/simplecheckout/spenden-3?email=mike@test.com&name=Mike
- Anonymous quick checkout of products possible through simplecheckout urls with &directpayment=True parameter transfers to /payment with a new res.partner for the SO and the product already in basket
  e.g.: /shop/simplecheckout/spenden-3?email=mike2@test.com&shipping_id=0&country_id=13&directpayment=True

TODO:

- Checkbox for Account Creation
- Checkbox for Newsletter reception (Maybe an Extra addon or included in website_sale_donate)
- User Quick Checkout direct to payment (Security Risks have to be considered!) if parnter_id or User_id, email and name in post and all are valid (correct parnter_id or user_id for email and name) then use this partner/user and jump directly to the payment page /shop/simplecheckout/spenden-3?email=mike2@test.com&name=Michael_Karrer&shipping_id=0&country_id=13&partner_id=24


HINT:

This addon depends on auth_signup for signup or account creation and can be used with auth_doubleoptin also.
